     * after creating it, or with guider.show(id) and the guider's id.
     *
     * guider.next() will advance to the next guider, and
     * guider.hideAll() will hide all Guiders (Speech Overlay).

     * its onclick handler.  A button named "Close" will have
     * its onclick handler set to guider.hideAll.  onclick handlers
     * can be customized too.
